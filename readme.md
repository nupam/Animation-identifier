### This repository contains a Pytorch(Fastai) IPYthon Notebook trained to identify 110+ different animated shows.
If the exact match is not found it tries to return the best match, for example if you show it a picture of girl in pink dress, it will most proably itentify her as Barbie or Disney Princess.<br>

#### To test the model, a web app is included in the server folder.
To run the server execute command: python3 server.py serve, then go to localhost:5042 in your browser.

To test the model, it needs to be downloaded from https://anupam.gq/ml/cartoon/export.pkl and put in server/models folder.
The dataset will be uploaded soon and link will be updated here.
